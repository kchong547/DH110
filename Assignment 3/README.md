# Step 1: Specify the research goal and requirements
## What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity that my project will support for users is being able to make it easier for users to find online resources to learn music theory on their own. By exploring online music theory services, this will hopefully help make learning music theory a more enjoyable experience for all demographics of students.

## What are the basic need/goals for the activity?
This activity delivers a user’s basic need to have the freedom to explore their own hobbies regardless of their background or ability. Users should not have to struggle to find resources that will help them learn independently. 

## What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs? What are some limitations of those options?
Currently, the traditional solution to learn music theory is to either take a class or hire a private tutor. However, this makes learning music theory an unfriendly experience for older or low income students. Many people start early when learning music and many classes are targeted towards a younger audience such as those still in grade school. Older students may feel alienated by younger students, which may discourage them from pursuing their interests. 

Another alternative is to hire a private tutor to teach music theory. However, this option is unfriendly to those who are low income and cannot afford private lessons.

Yet another alternative is for users to learn through written material. However, this form of media is extremely limited for learning music as there are no audio components to books. It would be difficult to learn music without listening to various notes and hearing how various rules should sound.

# Step 2: Identify the target users 
## What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
### Demographic: 
People who are looking to learn music theory independently and on their own time. These people are likely to be college students or older.

### Preferences: 
Users want to be able to learn music at their own pace and independently.

### Expertise:
Users of all backgrounds should be able to use this application.

## In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
People usually pursue their own interests on their own time. Users would learn music independently whenever they have the free time to do so. In addition, most users would learn how to play music or music theory in the comfort of their own homes. 

## What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
In order to learn music theory or how to play music, users learning independently would seek resources online or through books. Users could search on the internet or go to a library to obtain the resources they need.


# Step 3: Pick a research method
## Methods
I decided to use participatory observation through an activity where the interviewee walked me through exploring his resources to learn music.
The interview consisted of the following sections:
Background: I wanted to get to know about the participants previous knowledge about learning music as that would affect the processes that they would use and already know. Learning about the participant’s typical learning style would be very important to understanding what kind of tools and resources they gravitate towards.
Observation: I allowed the user to guide me through their process of how they would start learning music. I asked clarifying questions to better understand why they chose certain resources and what about them made them so enticing.
Follow up questions: These questions consisted of asking about alternative resources that weren’t online or things they wish they could have while learning music.
The research was conducted over Zoom, by their own desk where they had access to both the internet and in person materials they use to learn music. This reflects an environment that people would normally be in to learn music on their own.

# Highlights from the interview:
## Why do you find YouTube particular or YouTube videos particularly useful for learning?
> You look at the comments section, you can actually get a lot of feedback about what this person is doing, you can see how validated, or maybe if he's doing something wrong people call them out for it, so I think there's a really good way to like. Just like absorb information and maybe filter out what you want, through YouTube the search algorithms are not bad either. I know that when you're looking for stuff online you get a lot of stuff you don't want to see. On YouTube it's like a little better, I think yeah.
 
## Do you feel any barriers when it comes to learning music, especially because you're doing it independently?
> I think the biggest barrier is feedback so I'm only going off of my own feedback right now. I'm not an expert in music, by any means, I think. And even if I were, it wouldn't be in the guitar obviously. It'd be like the piano so I wouldn't know what I'm doing or what I'm doing wrong. If there's like a better way to like maybe hold the guitar technically or like strum the guitar technically or pluck the guitar technically. I'm still kind of going off information and got like two years ago, so yeah I do think that, eventually, if I do have more time to like to commit to this activity or i'm not interested. I might look for a guitar teacher again just to have another source of validation because through the Internet, and on my own, I can't tell what I'm doing right or wrong.

## What kinds of information tools or people do you need to learn music? Can you give me a few examples the tools or applications that you use.
> The tool, so you might need I mean obviously YouTube is a great source on if you want to learn about anything. If you have an actual person teaching you, they also might refer you to online sources for you to practice on your own time, then I just feel like using a metronome or like finding sheet music stuff like that, but yeah.

## Reflection
I found that this interview was a lot more eye opening than expected. Since the interview was a bit more like a conversation than the last assignment, there were new struggles that I need to learn from before conducting another interview like this again. I found that since we were having a conversation, I had to readjust the script on the fly as the participant would answer some of the questions before I had the chance to ask. Thus, I had to adjust the script on the spot or omit some questions. I also had to rephrase some of the questions and the structure of the script so the questions would prompt more than a “yes” or a “no”. I definitely need to improve on adjusting to unforeseen circumstances and also ask better follow up questions to prompt more discussion from the participant. The candidate also asked follow up questions or got stuck, which helped me realize which questions needed more definition should this interview be conducted again. 

The candidate had a much more extensive musical background than expected, which also gave me very valuable insight of what more experienced learners might be looking for. A beginner may not have known that the comment sections or view count of a video add credibility to online resources. A more experienced participant would know what works best for music learning that a beginner might not be able to understand. 

Overall, this interview was a valuable experience to teach me that it's really important to understand and directly interact with your user base so you can design products better.
