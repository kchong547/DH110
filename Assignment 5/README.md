# Description 

## Purpose
The project aims to create a platform for better music learning experience. The purpose of creating a low fidelity prototype is to have a low-cost method to design and test the organization of a product. This is important because it allows for potential design problems to be uncovered and for users to voice their opinions before the final product is crafted.

## User Research
Based on research done through contextual inquiry, there are 3 features of focus:
- How to organize lessons in a way that is comprehensible and easy to people of all backgrounds to focus on what they want to learn.
- How to present information in a credible manner so that users can help each other learn and verify the information presented in the video
- How to create a platform where musicians can interact with one another and present opportunities for each other

## Personas 
For the sake of the product, 2 personas were created to better understand how users may interact with the product. These personas were created after interviewing users who are learning music.
1. Mark is a passionate math teacher who teaches high school students. In his free time, Mark has started picking up the guitar. He used to play piano but stopped once he graduated high school. He has some understanding of music theory but wants to refresh and deepen his understanding of it.  Currently, Mark is using Youtube to further his understanding but struggles with the wide variety of videos available. 
2. Kevin is a recent graduate student who pursued a computer science degree. Throughout his time as a student, Kevin pursued playing the saxophone and joined a student organization on campus focusing on bringing woodwind musicians together. Now that heâ€™s graduated college, Kevin wants to continue to refresh his understanding of music theory and maintain a community of musicians he can learn with. Kevin is also interested in sharing his knowledge of music theory.
