# Introduction
Musictheory.net is a website created to share lessons, exercises, and tools relating to music theory. The user is able to search for interactive lessons on various topics and practice what they just learned in exercises. To further their own independent learning, tools are provided that the user can use to deepen their own understanding. 

After conducting a heuristic analysis on the website, several issues of the website were revealed. Here are a few that were found:
- Navigation of the website from lessons, exercise, and tools was difficult. The poor visibility makes it difficult for users to know what page they're on.
- Users are forced to use recall rather than recognition as there is no navigation bar present in lessons, exercises, and tools. Users need to use their memories to navigate to a page of their choice.
- The website lacks flexibility of efficiency of use. There are no multiple ways to navigate to a particular area of the website.
- Options are not clear for the user, suggesting poor reognition rather than recall. Information needed to use the product is not immediately visible.

# The purpose of UT
Usability testing is the process of testing a product or service through users representative of a population. Researchers will ask a participant to perform task and observe the participants behavior, reactions, and feedback to these tasks. The purpose of usability testing is to identify the problems in the design of the product, learn how to improve the product, and learn about the behaviors and preferences of those who may use the product. Usability testing suggests that the designs of UX designers should be influenced by how users interact with the design.

## How the test is conducted
The usability test was conducted using a survey on google forms. The design of the test is a remote moderated, portable minimalistic lab. The user and I will sit in separate rooms and converse through zoom. I will ask the user for their informed consent to record their responses and record the test. The user will conduct 3 tasks and provide detailed feedback about their methodology, comfort, satisfaction, and suggestions for the website. The user will then provide demographic information should they be comfortable with sharing. 

## What will be tested
The participant will be asked to conduct 3 different tasks to confirm the issues of the website listed above. I hope to improve the websites by adding more flexible and obvious ways to navigate the website so users could use it to its full potential. I hope that participants will be able to confirm my suspicions and also point out other flaws that I didn't consider before

Here are the three tasks listed below:
1. Find a lesson about the introduction to chords and interact with the exercise. This tests to see if users can navigate the website and to see if users intuitively use their mouse or the arrow buttons at the bottom of the page to navigate the lesson.
2. Find an exercise about chord identification from the current lesson. This is to test website navigation since there isn't a navigation bar provided from the current lesson.
3. Customize the exercise and reveal the answer to the exercise. This is to test if the user could find certain options and test recognition rather than recall.

One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what did not go well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.
# Reflection
Overall, the UT process went smoothly but there were definitely areas of improvement. One thing I did not really expect was the overall ease that the participant had with using the website. Though there were some small hiccups that confirms some of the usability issues listed above, the candidate was able to navigate with ease. However, the participant is extremely knowledgeable with navigating websites, which may not be representative of the user base that we are seeking to understand (middle aged men). One thing I would do differently is definitely change the structure of the survey. I would find a way so that the user could fill out the form on their own instead of me having to list out all the different options. However, I would also have to think of ways for the moderator still to engage with the participant as they are filling out the form so it is not awkward for the both of them. Something else I would do differently in case a participant did not know how to properly communicate their thoughts is to give an example and prompt time to ask questions instead of waiting for the participant to speak up. Overall, this was a prety eye opening experience and I cannot wait to see how other participants navigate through the website.
